# Eval Guesser

A chess training application that combines position evaluation practice with playing against Stockfish. Master chess evaluation by testing your positional understanding against the world's strongest chess engine.

## Features

### ðŸŽ® Play vs Computer
Challenge Stockfish at various skill levels from beginner to master.

- **Adjustable Difficulty**: 20 skill levels to match any player strength
- **Color Selection**: Play as white or black
- **Real-time Evaluation**: Optional evaluation bar showing position assessment
- **Move History**: Track all moves in standard algebraic notation
- **Game Controls**: New game and undo functionality
- **Clean Interface**: Distraction-free playing experience

### ðŸ“Š Analysis Board
Analyze any chess position with deep Stockfish evaluation.

- **FEN Support**: Load any position via FEN string
- **Deep Analysis**: Configurable analysis depth (1-20)
- **Multi-line Analysis**: See top 5 best moves with evaluations
- **Real-time Updates**: Live position evaluation as you explore moves
- **Move List**: Comprehensive list of best moves with centipawn evaluations
- **Evaluation Bar**: Visual representation of position assessment

### ðŸŽ¯ Eval Guesser Game (Coming Soon)
Test your evaluation skills by guessing Stockfish's position assessment.

- Compare your evaluation to Stockfish's analysis
- Track accuracy over time
- Learn to recognize critical position features

## Technical Details

### Evaluation System
- Evaluations are measured in **centipawns** (1/100th of a pawn)
- All evaluations are from white's perspective for consistency
- Positive values favor white, negative values favor black
- Checkmate evaluations show as "Mate in X"

### Architecture

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: SvelteKit with TypeScript
- **Chess Board**: Chessground (lichess board library)
- **Chess Logic**: chess.js for move validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design

#### Chess Engine
- **Engine**: Stockfish 16 NNUE compiled to WebAssembly
- **Communication**: UCI protocol via Web Workers
- **Analysis**: Multi-principal variation (MultiPV) support
- **Performance**: Runs entirely in the browser

### Key Components

#### `EvaluationBar.svelte`
Visual evaluation display that updates in real-time based on Stockfish analysis. Properly handles checkmate positions and shows accurate centipawn values.

#### `gameManager.ts`
Manages game state for playing against the computer:
- Handles player and computer moves
- Manages Stockfish worker for AI moves
- Tracks game state (check, checkmate, stalemate)
- Configurable difficulty levels

#### `uciParser.ts`
Robust UCI protocol parser that:
- Handles iterative deepening without losing moves
- Parses multi-line analysis (MultiPV)
- Extracts evaluation scores and best moves
- Manages analysis state across depth iterations

#### `moveConversion.ts`
Converts between UCI notation and Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN) for display.
